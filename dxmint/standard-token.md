# Standard Token

* Ô∏è Perfect Utility Token
* No Special Functions like additional fees
* Basic Send/Approve/Allowance Contract An ERC20 token contract keeps track of fungible tokens: any one token is exactly equal to any other token; no tokens have special rights or behavior associated with them. This makes ERC20 tokens useful for things like a medium of exchange currency, voting rights, staking, and more.
