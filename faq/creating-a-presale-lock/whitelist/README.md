## How Many Addresses **Can I add**?

* At once?&#x20;
  * Depends on the Network speed, we did tests with 500 Addresses at once and it worked, but we had days when the speed of the network, for example was very slow and we had to split up our lists in parts of 50 Addresses at once. &#x20;
* Overall?
  * Basically the maximum size of an array is 2^(64) -1, which is kindly enough.&#x20;
