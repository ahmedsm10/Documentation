**Dxsale.app is a pure decentralized launchpad by DxSale.Network.**

The DeFi launchpad allows anyone to transfer their minted contract tokens to raise capital.

Because the DeFi launchpad has custom tokens, you must review to determine for yourself if the owner has good intentions with his tokens. Join our active investors chats to get some feedback on various presales happening on the platform.
