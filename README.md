**Dxsale.app is a pure decentralized launchpad by DxSale.Network.**

The DeFi launchpad allows anyone to transfer their minted contract tokens to raise capital.

Because the DeFi launchpad has custom tokens, you must review to determine for yourself if the owner has good intentions with his tokens. Join our active investors chats to get some feedback on various presales happening on the platform.

## I am new, what should I check?

* Anything that has a really high Hardcap for a meme coin I would avoid. 
* Anything that has a long presale end time like more than a day at max I would avoid unless it seems like a legitimate project other than a clone of a clone of a clone
* Anything that has a softcap that is less than half the hardcap I would avoid
* Anything that has a pancake listing rate higher than presale I would avoid \(Higher meaning you get more tokens per bnb on pancake then presale\)
* Anything that has a pancake listing rate that is half or less presale rate I would avoid\(Lower  meaning you get less tokens per bnb on pancake then presale\)
* Anything missing logos, telegram group, website I would avoid
* Anything that has a very inactive dev in telegram group I would avoid
* Anything that has a telegram group count of under 50 people I would avoid
* Anything that doesn't have a twitter account I would avoid
* If the presale is popular and you missed out might be worthwhile to grab some tokens after an initial presale sell off

## T**oDo List**

We all know everyone likes detailed roadmaps but this space requires nimble and pivoting. Hence, it's pointless to provide waterfall milestones and schedules, rather here's a list of which we will work on \(majority of which, scope will grow and shrink based on market\).

* Infrastructure Upgrade
* BSC-ETH Bridge
* V3 Upgrade - Launchpad
  * Buy & Burn Model implementation
  * Presale voting prior to developer finalization
  * All remaining Presale Token should be burnt. not stay in the smart contract
  * Scanning Tool
  * Sidebar - add additional information
  * Connecting Network and Wallet Optimizations
* New Integrations \(Networks, Timeline TBA\)
* Decentralized "Starter" Launchpad
  * Landing Page, Eligibility, Uniqueness
* DxSwap
  * Useful Aggregation tools all in one place to close out the token journey from Launch -&gt; Market
