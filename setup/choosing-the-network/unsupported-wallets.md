# Unsupported Wallets

**There are many different Wallets on the market, if you refuse to use the recommend wallets which we are suggesting, we cant give you the full support.**

### **TrustWallet**

Since Trustwallet is not really supported from our DAPP you will have some significant Problems to interact with our Platform.

If you still want to use Trustwallet, make sure you understand how to use your device.

For Trustwallet you can't use the https version of our website you gotta use the following link:

### WalletConnect

For using unsupported Wallets on our website we still recommend using the protocol WalletConnect, which makes a lot of Wallets compatible to use on every platform without having the perfect support for them.
